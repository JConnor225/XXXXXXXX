# My First README.md
## __Introduction__
---
There certainly was a lot of material to absorb this first week, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of things. I never knew there was such a community online that was specifically for creating and sharing code. It's still a lot to handle and is proving a little difficult. Some of the things I learned this week:
* GitHub
* Markdown syntax
* Atom text editor
* Directories and repos
* Proper file management

Attached is an image of my file directory, organized as instructed: ![screenshot of my directory](./images/screenshot-1.png)

## __Difficulties__
Besides using GitHub, another site I used for information was [Lynda.](https://www.lynda.com/) However, there are still some things I need to spend some more time on.
  1. GitHub navigation
  2. Markdown syntax and formatting
  3. Atom navigation and commands

  I currently feel very overwhelmed with all of this new information and making my way through two totally new programs with totally unique workflows.

  Here is one additional line of text.
## __Conclusion__
In conclusion, I learned a ton of new concepts this week and was introduced to both Atom and Github...both provided plenty of difficulties for me to navigate and learn from and even though it was daunting, I feel like I have a much better understanding of very basic web design as well as creating and sharing code through repositories. I enjoyed getting an intro to HTML even though it seems to be rather tedious practice. Although some HTML is very simple, for example```<h2>GZA, Killah Priest</h2>```
