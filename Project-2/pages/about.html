      Here at Smoothies International, we simply love smoothies! We were
    inspired to create this Instructable after feeling we had perfected our recipe.
    After years of experimentation and trial and error, we feel confident we can bring
    you the best and most versatile smoothie recipe on the planet. We wanted to create
    this site not only to share our own recipes and ideas, but to be able to reach
    out across the globe to smoothie enthusiasts everywhere and gain new knowledge.<br><br>

    We simply love seeing submissions and questions from readers all around the world.
    It is amazing to be able to reach out to so many en-smoothie-asts worldwide,
    and we've seen so many great recipes and ideas come through our mailbox! Please
    continue to upload recipes and photos through our Submissions page, as we absolutely love
    to hear your thoughts and, of course, see your smoothies. <br><br>

    Lastly, we'd like to offer some notes on the Instructable we've presented here. First and
    foremost, DON'T BE AFRAID TO EXPERIMENT! We've offered this as more of a template
    than a traditional recipe, allowing you to fill in the gaps with your own creativity.
    Try different fruit combinations, or fruits you've never tried before. Try experimenting with your liquid base as well.
    Orange juice, ice cream, coconut milk, almond milk or chocolate milk can all produce different results,
    but they all can be used to make great smoothies when used creatively. </p> <br>
